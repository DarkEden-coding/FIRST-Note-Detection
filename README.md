This is a project aimed at making a framework for detecting objects and thier respective positions on a ground plane, spesificly game pieces in FIRST Robotics compititions. This project uses the YOLOv8 framework and onnx ai format to optomize for SBC's like the OrangePi or RaspberryPi. This is still in the devolopment faze with bad github practices as it is only meant for my robotics team @frc3322.
